# GitHub Packages Configuration
# Copy this file to .npmrc in your project root (or home directory) to use GitHub Packages
# 
# Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username or organization name
# 
# For scoped packages like @cmdquery/log-ingestion-next, you need to configure the registry:
@cmdquery:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}

# To publish, you'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token with 'write:packages' permission
# Set it as an environment variable:
# export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
#
# Or add it directly to .npmrc (not recommended for security):
# //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_your_token_here
